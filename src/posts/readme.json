        "Readmes often start with a vague yet confident declaration justifying a project's existence. So why does this page exist? I guess my 6th grade English teacher stroked my ego enough that I actually think the things I write and make are actually worth putting on the internet.",
        "I'm headed into my 4th year of college, and it's been a while since the products of my creativity have be awarded inherent value because they were created by someone young. But I've always wanted a fishbowl for myself, with enough fake kelp and aquarium substrate around that I'm reminded that the words and photos and music I create still have irreplaceable and irrevokable value. And if there just happens to be someone around who enjoys watching a stupid little goldfish swim around a small, cramped fishbowl, then great. Welcome!",
        "I hope that soon, this blog will be populated with some stories that mean the world to me. And that's not just a turn of phase.",
        "I'm reminded quite often, especially by my mom, that I have the memory of a goldfish. And it's true: nine times out of ten I can't tell you what I just had for lunch.",
        "But for every bit of productivity I lose because of my complete total inability to perform instant recall, I feel that God has rewarded me with the ability to fully recall and re-experience stories through language, visuals, and sounds. He's allowed me to explore the precious stories that define who I am and the stories of others that beautifully intersect with my own.",
